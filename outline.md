- linktreelike - indigo
- llink to ffriends wwebsites,,, - blu

hi. indigo speaking. putting everything in one list like that is. to be generous. a bad idea. so im going to refactor this and split it up into sections. one for each page or section. so we can plan things out in an organized way. shocking i know  

### FRONT PAGE

- small profile card
- link to main page
- cool background. make sure of that

### MAIN PAGE

- links to stuff. obviously
- formatted like. a bunch of boxes ?
- optional background music ?
- areas for interests
- link to friends websites
- yeah. sure. puppy area. why not ? what does that even mean ?

### SYSTEM DIRECTORY

- member list
- search function
- groups and tags

### MEMBER PAGES

- pronouns.cc inspired
- but way better. infinitely customizable. they get to put themselves into their pages
- that does complicate things though. because ideally wed have data storage. files for all the data for every member
- meaning. no wait it could work. they just need to add elements with specific ids or classes that the javascript will know to fill
- yes my dumbass is trying to oop static html websites. sue me
- pronouns list. names list
- better descriptions
- photo galleries ? with alt texts ?
- relationship denotations ?
- embed alters songs
- ability for headmates to comment on each others pages. or maybe not only just headmates. @lightbulb @gearbox make websites. we can link them together. we can autism. caroline is affecting me

### OC PAGES ?

- how necessary is this given that by the time we finish this website we probably wont have any ocs left that arent alters
- we could have a section about the story though

### ART CORNER
