# > Reader: Access prestigiously maintained planning document.

- so we should make stuff -caroline
- pronouns.cc like member pages. headmate comment system - indigo
- place to show off stuff we like - indigo
- ppuppy area ?,,, - blu,
- art area - indigo
- linktreelike - indigo
- llink to ffriends wwebsites,,, - blu

hi. indigo speaking. putting everything in one list like that is. to be generous. a bad idea. so im going to refactor this and split it up into pieces. one for each page or section. so we can plan things out in an organized way. shocking i know  

### FRONT PAGE

- small profile card
- link to main page
- cool background. make sure of that

### MAIN PAGE

- links to stuff. obviously
- formatted like. a bunch of boxes ?
- optional background music ?
- areas for interests
- link to friends websites
- yeah. sure. puppy area. why not ? what does that even mean ?
- changelog ?

### SYSTEM DIRECTORY

- member list
- search function
- groups and tags

### MEMBER PAGES

- pronouns.cc inspired
- but way better. infinitely customizable. they get to put themselves into their pages
- that does complicate things though. because ideally wed have data storage. files for all the data for every member
- meaning. no wait it could work. they just need to add elements with specific ids or classes that the javascript will know to fill
- yes my dumbass is trying to oop static html websites. sue me
- pronouns list. names list
- better descriptions
- photo galleries ? with alt texts ?
- relationship denotations ?
- embed alters songs
- ability for headmates to comment on each others pages. or maybe not only just headmates. @lightbulb @gearbox make websites. we can link them together. we can autism. caroline is affecting me
- try to keep them relatively brief. members can have their own site sections to put any actual content and stuff

### MEMBER PAGES. THE OTHER ONES

- the system directory could function as. more like pronouns.cc bios. and these could be actual personal web pages
- probably reserved to members who. show up frequently enough to warrant them. and who are actually interested in having them
- i can kind of tell bell really wants one

### OC PAGES ?

- how necessary is this given that by the time we finish this website we probably wont have any ocs left that arent alters
- we could have a section about the story though

### PUBLIC TO DO LIST

- pretty much what it says. list of things to be done
- timestamps ?
- list of completed tasks ?
- i remember doing something similar with the castle wars discord bot site. for some reason

### PRIVATE TO DO LISTS

- limited access lists. for friends and psys
- obfuscate them ?
- password limited
- how about. you have to type a code on the to do list page and it redirects you to a really fucked up and unguessable ciphered url. where you also have to put in a password just in case
- encrypt and decrypt the text in the code so that people cant just find it in the repository ?
- but that means anyone could find the source text. and the cipher code. and break it easily
- fetch the text from some kind of server ?
- those usually cost money though
- i could use an html obfuscator but im pretty sure those can be reversed
- upon researching it might not be ? so if i do it right it could be impermeable. problem is it takes up a decent amount of space. hopefully not enough to be a problem

### ART CORNER

- art tags and descriptions

### CODING DISTRICT

- place to put. coding stuff

### SOMETHING GAY

- obviously.

### ERROR 404 PAGE

- variants for every member
- doodle + quote ?

## other things to remember to set up

- sitemap
- robots.txt
- remove html file extensions using folders with index files in them. or htaccess but that sounds complicated
- rss feed ?
- webmentions ?
- web components
- favicon
- summary + details elements
- text highlight colour ?
- link icons
- hovercards ?
- header image / banner
